# HTTP Utils library for Go

This is a Go library with various HTTP utils.
Right now there are some basic tripperwares/client middlewares/interceptors,
but I plan to extend this library with other helpers, i.e TLS helpers,
server middlewares etc.

# Usage

TODO

For now please take a look at the documentation
